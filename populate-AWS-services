  # AWS Fargate
  ## Serverless compute for containers
  
  Deploy and manage your applications, not infrastructure. Fargate removes the operational overhead of scaling, patching, securing, and managing servers.
  
  Monitor your applications via built-in integrations with AWS services like Amazon CloudWatch Container Insights. Gather metrics and logs with third-party tools.
  
  Improve security through workload isolation by design. Amazon ECS tasks and Amazon EKS pods run in their own dedicated runtime environment.
  
  Only pay for what you use. Fargate scales the compute to closely match your specified resource requirements. With Fargate, there is no over-provisioning and paying for additional servers.

  # AWS Lambda
  ## Run code without thinking about servers or clusters
  
  Run code without provisioning or managing infrastructure. Simply write and upload code as a .zip file or container image.
  Automatically respond to code execution requests at any scale, from a dozen events per day to hundreds of thousands per second.
  Save costs by paying only for the compute time you use—by per-millisecond—instead of provisioning infrastructure upfront for peak capacity.
  Optimize code execution time and performance with the right function memory size. Respond to high demand in double-digit milliseconds with Provisioned Concurrency.

  # Amazon API Gateway
  ## Create, maintain, and secure APIs at any scale
  
  Amazon API Gateway is a fully managed service that makes it easy for developers to create, publish, maintain, monitor, and secure APIs at any scale. APIs act as the "front door" for applications to access data, business logic, or functionality from your backend services. Using API Gateway, you can create RESTful APIs and WebSocket APIs that enable real-time two-way communication applications. API Gateway supports containerized and serverless workloads, as well as web applications.

  API Gateway handles all the tasks involved in accepting and processing up to hundreds of thousands of concurrent API calls, including traffic management, CORS support, authorization and access control, throttling, monitoring, and API version management. API Gateway has no minimum fees or startup costs. You pay for the API calls you receive and the amount of data transferred out and, with the API Gateway tiered pricing model, you can reduce your cost as your API usage scales.
